# SENG21213-OS — Stage 0: Kernel Foundations

> **Course**: SENG 21213 – Computer Architecture & Operating Systems  
> **Year**: 2nd Year, Software Engineering  
> **Assignment**: Build your own x86 Operating System

## What Is This?

This is **Stage 0** of your semester-long OS assignment. Over 5 lecture milestones
(Lectures 8–12), your team will transform this minimal kernel into a functioning
operating system with process management, threading, memory management, and a
file system.

## Milestone Schedule

| Lecture | Milestone | Files to Add |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| L08 | ✅ Stage 0 – Boot + VGA + Shell | *Given to you* |
| L09 | Process Management | `kernel/process.c`, `kernel/scheduler.c` |
| L10 | Threads & Synchronisation | `kernel/thread.c`, `kernel/mutex.c` |
| L11 | Memory Management | `kernel/pmm.c`, `kernel/vmm.c` |
| L12 | File System | `kernel/fs.c`, `kernel/ramdisk.c` |

---

## Quick Start
## Stage 0 Status — v0.1-stage0

**Status: Complete.** Kernel boots cleanly in QEMU with zero build warnings.

### Shell commands implemented

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| \help\ | List all available commands |
| \clear\ | Clear the screen |
| \echo <text>\ | Print arguments back to the screen |
| \ersion\ | Print kernel name and version string |
| \colour <fg> <bg>\ | Change text colour (0-15 for each) |
| \halt\ | Disable interrupts and halt the CPU |
| \bout\ | Course/build info (extension) |
| \mem\ | Memory map stub (extension, real PMM comes in L11) |

### How to test

\\ash
make clean && make
make run
\
Inside the QEMU window, try:
\help
version
colour 2 0
echo hello world
clear
halt
\
### Notes

- Fixed a GCC 15.2 / C23 compatibility issue: \ool\ is now a reserved keyword,
  which conflicted with the freestanding \	ypedef uint8_t bool;\ in \include/types.h\.
  Resolved by adding \-std=gnu99\ to the Makefile CFLAGS.
- Added \ersion\, \colour\, and \halt\ shell commands (required by the assignment
  spec) to \kernel/kernel.c\, since the provided starter kit only shipped
  \help\, \clear\, \bout\, \echo\, and \mem\.

### Option A: Docker (Recommended for all platforms)

```bash
# 1. Install Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux)
# 2. Build the image once:
docker build -t seng21213-os-builder .

# 3. Build the OS:
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/os seng21213-os-builder

# 4. Run in QEMU (install QEMU locally):
qemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=seng21213-os.img -m 32M
```

### Option B: Native Linux/WSL2

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install nasm gcc gcc-multilib binutils qemu-system-x86 make

# Build
make all

# Run
make run
```

### Option C: macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install nasm x86_64-elf-binutils qemu

# You also need an i686-elf-gcc cross-compiler:
# See: https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler
make all
make run
```

## Understanding the Boot Process

```
Power On
  │
  ▼
BIOS (firmware in ROM)
  │  Loads 512-byte MBR from disk sector 1 into RAM at 0x7C00
  ▼
boot/boot.asm  (Real Mode, 16-bit)
  │  Prints "Loading SENG21213-OS..."
  │  Reads 64 sectors (kernel) from disk into RAM at 0x10000
  │  Sets up GDT (Global Descriptor Table)
  │  Switches CPU to 32-bit Protected Mode
  │  Far-jumps to 0x10000
  ▼
kernel/kernel_entry.asm  (Protected Mode, 32-bit)
  │  Calls kernel_main()
  ▼
kernel/kernel.c  →  kernel_main()
  │  vga_init()     – set up text display
  │  kb_init()      – set up keyboard
  │  print_splash() – welcome screen
  │  shell_run()    – interactive shell (infinite loop)
  ▼
Your code from here...

## Building Lecture 9: Process Management

When you reach Lecture 9, you'll add process support. Here's the interface to implement:

```c
/* kernel/process.h  — you write this! */

#define MAX_PROCESSES    16
#define STACK_SIZE     4096

typedef enum { READY, RUNNING, BLOCKED, TERMINATED } proc_state_t;

typedef struct pcb {
    uint32_t      pid;
    proc_state_t  state;
    uint32_t      esp;          /* Saved stack pointer */
    uint32_t      eip;          /* Saved instruction pointer */
    uint32_t      stack[STACK_SIZE / 4];
    struct pcb   *next;         /* For linked-list ready queue */
} pcb_t;

void   process_init(void);
pcb_t *process_create(void (*entry)(void));
void   process_yield(void);        /* Trigger context switch */
void   process_exit(void);
void   scheduler_tick(void);       /* Called by timer IRQ (Lecture 10) */
```

## Debugging Tips

```bash
# Debug with GDB
make run-debug
# In another terminal:
gdb
(gdb) target remote :1234
(gdb) set architecture i386
(gdb) symbol-file build/kernel.elf
(gdb) break kernel_main
(gdb) continue

# Inspect the disk image
xxd seng21213-os.img | head -32    # View MBR
xxd seng21213-os.img | grep -c aa55  # Verify boot signature
```
